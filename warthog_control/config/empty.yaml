# The empty Warthog extras configuration has nothing in it and should not.
# It is meant to override the default to add custom control parameters
# file in your own Warthog customization package and setting WARTHOG_CONFIG_EXTRAS
# to your customization file in the launch fil control.launch.
# Each parameter will need to be loaded in the correct namespace to
# be used.
